# DC Food App documentation

To use the App: https://mackenzieyoung.shinyapps.io/DC_food/

This App was created as part of the final project for the Developing Data Products course in the JHU Coursera Data Science specialization.

Data was downloaded from: http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/

To use this App, select the food option type you wish to view from the sidebar on the right.
Click on a dot on the map to view the name of the location.

The sidebar also contains an option to show only locations within a 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mile radius of the clicked location.

Enjoy!
